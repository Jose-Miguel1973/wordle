# wordle
You will need to have both the wordle and wordleProject files to be able to run the wordle.
You will also need the stop_words file as it will stop extremely common words from being added to the dictionaries and it's necessary to run the whole program.
For testing I have added the text file Alice so you can try it out if you don't have a specific file to use.
